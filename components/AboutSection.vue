    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>First - I want to attribute ALL astrological explanations and insights to Joanna Martine Woolfolk's book,  <a href="https://a.co/d/0rDoknD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need <span class="screen-reader-only">(link opens in a new tab)</span></a> (2012). All of the astrological descriptions used in this project come from her book, and I couldn't have created this project without it.</p>
    <p>
      This site started as an assignment for my HTML300 Javascript and Advanced CSS course, where the main requirement was use of an API of my choice. I wanted to come up with something that would be both fun to make, and also have enough substance to keep me from running out of content ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a <a href="https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyrule Compendium API by Aarav Borthakur <span class="screen-reader-only">(link opens in a new tab)</span> </a> listed in a GitHub Repo of public APIs.  I looked into a few others that interested me, but none of them sparked as much inspiration as this one. I had recently finished playing Breath of the Wild, and I've always enjoyed Twitter threads and Instagram posts designating characters, images, etc to the astrological signs. They are a lighthearted and fun way to view ourselves and others through a new lens. </p>
    <p>
      I had to do a lot of work on this project from outside the use of the API. I ended up mostly just using the API to create a full monster list, since I was plotting out and transcribing the astrological combinations with the monsters myself. But even now, I have ideas for expanding this fun project! I would love to come up with some side quests based on a user's Moon Sign, or designate a Weapon, Bow, and Shield based on Sun/Moon/Rising Signs. If the Compendium included clothing items, I would absolutely do outfits based on the signs. I'd love to incorporate an astrology API to aid users in getting their natal chart rather than pointing them to another site. There are so many aspects of Zelda and Astrology that I didn't even touch on this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you enjoy this brain child of mine and don't take offense at being called three different types of monsters. 
    </p>
